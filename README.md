### Here's Looking at Euclid

# Todo

- Make line hash marks
- Simplify language, esp. of prop enuciations?
- Add sections to steps, make sections of proofs explicit?

- Add content (Book I: rest of props)
- Placeholders for other books?
- Write intros (overall, Book I, etc)
- Appendix?

- side nav instead of dropdown
- add top level landing page, above Elements
- make hierarchy parts links
- visual: tone down borders
- visual: display font for headings

- Crazy idea:
  - expand drawing area to full page
  - interleave drawing and text
  - describe steps and diagram in same system
  - animate everything
  - put step navigation into floating buttons
