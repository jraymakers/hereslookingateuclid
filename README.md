### Here's Looking at Euclid

# Todo

- Header links - make them more discoverable
- Next/Prev buttons, make them in-line with book title?
- Make angle arc
- Make line hash marks
- Simplify language, esp. of prop enuciations?
- Add sections to steps, make sections of proofs explicit?

- Add content (Book I: rest of defs, posts, cns, and then rest of props)
- Placeholders for other books?
- Write intros (overall, Book I, etc)
- Appendix?

- Crazy idea:
  - expand drawing area to full page
  - interleave drawing and text
  - describe steps and diagram in same system
  - animate everything
  - put page navigation into menu (floating)
  - put step navigation into floating buttons
